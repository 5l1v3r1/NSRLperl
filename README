The contents of this directory serve as a convenient way to install the
prerequisites of the NSRL hashing code into the Knoppix environment. They
should not appear in the Knoppix distro itself.

The directory contains:

README -	 This file.

NSRLInstaller -  a simple shell script to install the Perl modules
		 required by the NSRL hashing code. CPAN and NSRL modules are
		 installed, in the correct order.

		 You need to be root to run this successfully (so that the
		 "make install" commands for the Perl modules will succeed).

DistroMods -	 The CPAN and NSRL Perl modules required by the hashing code,
		 in two separate subdirectories.
